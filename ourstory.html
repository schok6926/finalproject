        <center><font size="5"> <p>Our project compiles and spread resources, such as scholarships, free summer programs and college advice, to provide opportunities for all teenage students to succeed in the future. Education is key to social mobility and we hope to raise awareness of the opportunities that are available.</p> <font size>

        <center><font size="5"> <p>Gianna Bauzil, a student at the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program, came up with the idea for Open Door Opportunities. The inspiration for Open Door Opportunities came from her immigrant background and experience with scholarship and program applications. She realized that every teenager does not have the information or knowledge necessary in order to apply for financial and educational opportunities. She hopes that with the information on this website, all students, regardless of social or financial status, will be given the materials opportunities to excel in their chosen field.</p> <font size>

        <h1 class="w3-text-white">Why specifically focus on immigrants and women?</h1>
        <center><font size="5"> <p>Although our website aims to link high achieving students to opportunities, but we place a higher emphasis on promoting low-income immigrant and women to educational opportunities. Our website will include certain features, such as a community forum and women and immigrant spotlight pages to provide a sense of community and inspiration.</p> <font size>

        <center><font size="5"> <p>Although this website is for education and colleges, itâ€™s also used for encouragement and support. The dedication pages is to inspire those who should be more confident about themselves. It reveals how women and immigrants worked their way up to success and became big and how everyone else can do the same. Their stories and backgrounds can give hope to people and show how everyone can do more than they think they can do.</p> <font size>
